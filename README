Hello!  This is a little conglomeration of the games
Pente and Go, combined using conditional compilation
instead of something sensible and extensible.
Everything is written in D.  In order to compile Pente,
simply compile it with version string of 'pente'; Go is
'go'.  I compile with GDC, so I use the command
gdc -fversion=pente -lncurses -o pente
Replacing 'pente' with 'go' as the need may be.  The
specifics of the commands are different for other
compilers; look up the documentation if you need to.
